# Liefer

A plugin for Craft CMS 3 that consumes Element API JSON and makes it available in your Twig templates.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-RC1 or later and a valid JSON file generated by Craft's Element API.

## Installation

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require mijingo/liefer

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Liefer.

## Liefer Overview

Pass in a JSON URL or location (best is one generated by the Element API) and then output the data to your Twig template.


## Using Liefer

{% set quotes = craft.liefer.get({url: 'https://something.com/quotes.json')} %}

{% for quote in quotes %}
  {{ quote.body }}
